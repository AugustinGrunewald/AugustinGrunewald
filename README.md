# 👋 About me


I'm an **engineering student at ISAE-Supaero** in my final year. 🚀

I'm currently following the **Data and Decision Sciences program**, which is a Master-level specialization in **Data Science, modern Artificial Intelligence and Decision Support**.
The program is shared between four main modules (by order of priority): 
  - Algorithms in Machine Learning (Supervised, unsupervised, deep, and reinforcement learning) 💻
  - Data Engineering (Data storage, computation, and distribution) 💾
  - Applied Data Science (Data privacy and ethics, the digital economy, and applications of data science) 📑
  - Seminars (Seminars from professional experts, training sessions, and challenges) 🏢
---
In parallel, I'm also taking courses in **Energy, Transport and the Environment**, which aim to give us a **transdisciplinary vision** (combining law, economics and engineering sciences) to better understand the **relationships between technological development, energy and the environment** (climate). 
Specifically, we explore the following points: 
  - Energy and climate ⚡
  - Economics and ecology 📈
  - Transport and intermodality 🚌
  - Case studies in optimization 📊
---
My goal is to be able to **combine these two areas of expertise** so that, through my future work, I can have a **concrete impact in the fight against climate change**. 🌍

In particular, I have a **strong interest in the rail sector** 🚅, which I see as one of the solutions to be developed as a priority in the years to come. 
I've already been able to take engineering courses on this subject during my training and I'd like to go further by **bringing my know-how to this sector**.
